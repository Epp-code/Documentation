= SML Feature Tests

**SML Feature Tests** is a mod that contains code for verifying that SML features are behaving as intended.
Since it does not always follow good mod coding practices in the interest of being a more useful test,
it is purposefully not distributed with the Starter Project to avoid confusing developers with bad examples
and polluting the project with classes and assets that will never be present in an end user's game.

That being said,
it can be a useful resource for understanding how various SML features are expected to behave
and as an inspiration for how to test your own mods.

The mod is available https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SMLFeatureTests[on GitHub]
and can be brought into the project via
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/ImportingAnotherMod.adoc[standard mod importing procedures].
