Have you been holding off on implementing a MAM research tree in your mod because of how tedious it is?
Wait no more!

The new Research Tree Editor allows you to create and edit research trees in a visual interface
and provides basic error checking functionality.

To launch the tool, navigate to the `SMLEditor Content/ResearchTree/` folder in the Content Browser,
right click on the `ResearchTreeHelper` asset, then select `Run Editor Utility Widget`.
Hover over elements in the tool to see tooltips explaining what they do.

The Example Mod has been updated with a complex research tree (created by the tool)
to demonstrate and explain some important research tree concepts.
Explore this tree, and the base game's trees, to learn more about how research trees work.
