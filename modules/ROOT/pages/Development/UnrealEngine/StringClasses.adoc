# Unreal String Classes

Unreal offers different storage types for strings, each with its own use case.

This page serves as a brief overview of the 3 main string classes available in Unreal Engine 5
and how they relate to modding.

For more detailed information about these classes, check out the

## String Classes

### FText

If you are displaying a string to the end user, 99% of the time you want to be using this string type.
It is mutable, provides nice formatter methods, and has built in engine localization support.
In memory, FTexts store localization keys that point to external data providing the string's contents.

Special edits have been made to the modding engine to enable mods to take advantage of Unreal's localization system at the per-plugin level.
Read more about how to use it on the xref:Development/Localization.adoc[Localizing Mods] page.

In modding, FText should be used for any string you plan to display to the user.
For example, schematic names, item descriptions, UI text, predefined chat messages, etc.

### FName

FNames are designed to be more efficient in cases where you are using a string as an identifier.
They are case-insensitive and immutable.
The actual string contents of an FName are stored once in a global data table.
In memory, they are a 4 byte identifier that can be used with this table to retrieve the related string.

FNames are useful as keys in maps because checking their equality is fast regardless of the length of the string.

In modding, FNames should be used in identifier, keys, or any other string you deem its optimizations beneficial.

### FString

FStrings are generic mutable strings with no additional context.
They take up as much memory as they have characters and offer the "typical" string operations like find and replace, substring, concatenation, comparison, etc.

In modding, FString is generally used for log messages, strings that change contents often, or strings that doesn't benefit from the features of FText or FName.

## Conversion

Although **it is possible to convert between all of the string types**,
doing so usually results in **missing out on features or optimizations** offered by that type,
and you lose the information about the original type of the string.
For example, going from an FText to an FString loses you the context of its localization key,
meaning you can't go "back" to the same FText you started with, even if you never changed the underlying string.

To perform "typical" string operations on FText and FName you may need to convert them to FStrings first
- just remember that going back is either unsafe or impossible.

If you're trying to make a hardcoded value in one of these types,
make sure to use the "Literal" syntax for creating it rather than one of the conversion functions.
For example, use the `Make Literal Name` blueprint node instead of the `String to Name` conversion function.
