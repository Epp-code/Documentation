= Vanilla Dedicated Server API

The 1.0 release introduced two API endpoints to the base game's dedicated servers.

* **Dedicated Server Lightweight Query API**:
  a simple UDP protocol designed for polling the server state through UDP continuously with minimal overhead.
* **Dedicated Server HTTPS API**:
  a HTTPS server serving the requests to retrieve the more detailed state of the server, and control it's behavior.

The documentation for these APIs is provided in the
`DedicatedServerAPIDocs.md` markdown file
in the `CommunityResources` folder of your
xref:faq.adoc#Files_GameInstall[game install directory].
In the interest of keeping this documentation up-to-date
we will not be duplicating the API documentation here.
