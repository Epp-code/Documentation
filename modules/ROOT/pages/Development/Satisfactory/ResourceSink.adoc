= Resource Sink

By default, modded items can't be fed into the AWESOME Sink
to gather coupon points since they have no associated point values.

If you'd like your mod's items to be sinkable, you need to
specify how many points they provide when sinked.

SML provides a facility for you to easily load a list of FGItemDescriptors
and assign points values to them through the use of a Data Table.
Only one of these tables can exist per Game World (sub) Module.

== Data Table

To get started, go to a Content Browser window in the editor and add a new Data Table asset (it's an Advanced Asset in the Miscellaneous category).
You'll be prompted to select a Row Structure, pick `Resource Sink Points Data` from the dropdown.
Call it "Points_YourModName" or similar so it's easy to find later.

You'll need to create a row in the data table for each item you
want to be sinkable. The `Row Name` does not matter, the `Item Class` should be 
the FGItemDescriptor of the item, and the `Points` column is how many points it's worth
in the sink. You can go to the https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/AWESOME_Sink#Points_generated_per_item[Satisfactory Wiki] to see how many
points each vanilla item is worth for comparison. Consider making your item worth more
points than the sum of its components to encourage crafting and sinking
it as opposed to just sinking the raw materials. You can see the "point profit"
of various vanilla recipes https://satisfactory.wiki.gg/AWESOME_Sink#Recipe_point_improvement_ratios[here] for comparison.

There is an additional column, `Overridden Resource Sink Points`. This should always
be set to -1. CSS uses a script to automatically calculate point values for them,
and they use this column to manually override their generated values. Since we
are specifying our values by hand, we don't have any use for this column.
If you were to specify a value other than -1, the game would select the higher
point value of the two fields.

== Registering the Data Table

Now we just need to tell Satisfactory to load the contents of the data table.
Thankfully, SML can do this for you using the xref:Development/ModLoader/ModModules.adoc#_game_world_module_ugameworldmodule[Game World Module].
Simply set the `M Resource Sink Item Points Data Table` variable in the defaults tab
(in the Advanced subsection) to your own just created data table.
SML will read the contents and adds them to the resource sink systems for you.

== Overriding Vanilla Points Values

It is possible to override the base-game's specified points values for an item by listing it with a new points value in your mod's Resource Sink data table.

In the case that multiple mods specify a points value, the points value of the last mod to load will be the one used by the game.
