= Creating ADA and In-game Inbox Messages

[NOTE]
====
This page is a work in progress.
====

Ada messages can add an immersive feel to your mods fitting in with every in game milestone unlock.

[NOTE]
====
When the game loads it will look for all data assets with the class of FGMessage and load these automatically.
There is no requirement to manually register these data assets.

== What to Say

TODO info on what speaking patterns ADA and Aliens have

Use the SMLEditor/Content/AdaMessages/AdaMessageExtractor editor utility widget to quickly view all messages as text 

== Defining Messages

=== Creating the Data Asset:

First right click on the content browser and go to Miscellaneous -> Data Asset
Then Select the class of `FGMessage`

The name of the new data asset can be anything you would like, but recommend sticking to a normalized naming convention:
```
Asset_<ModName>_ADA_Message_Tier_<TierNumber>_<MilestoneNumber>
```

For Example:

```
Asset_ExampleMod_ADA_Message_Tier_1_1
```

This will refer to the example mods schematic for tier 1 and the first schematic.
This is optional but will help you distinguish each milestone if you have lots of ADA messages. 

=== Setting up the Email Message

As part of the new message data asset this will also create a new email that can be viewed in the `Inbox` window in game.

This is the first stage of setting up the Data Asset by setting the `Title` and `Message` variables:

=== Setting Up Subtitles

If your ADA speak is quite long then you will need to split this into multiple subtiles. This is because the text will not fit in the ADA popup widget.

This can be done by adding a new Array element to the `mSubtitles` variable.

Each element in the array should have `Subtitle` `Sender Class` and `Time Stamp`

* Subtitle - This is the text you want to show in the ADA popup message
* Sender Class - This is the class of the Sender aka ADA or Alien Message
* Time Stamp - This is the Time Stamp when the message should be sent. Correlates to the audio message timestamp if there is pauses.

Setting the voice over requires a Wwise Audio Event and can be set in the data asset.

=== Setting up the Trigger

The trigger is automatically registered when the game is loaded you just need to populate the trigger settings in the data asset

First set the Trigger Dependency this will be the `BP Schematic Purchased Dependency` and select the dependencies you would like this message to show for. 

Trigger Settings:

* Can Be Queued - This setting is for if another ada message is being played then it will wait for it complete.
* Can Be Repeated - This setting is for if the ada message can be repeated.
* Can Interupt - Setting for if another lower priority message is playing then interupt it.
* Play Interupt Message - This setting will first play the default interupt message then play our message.
* Blocked By Cooldown - Message will not play if in the message cooldown - Recommended not to check this.
* Priority - The priority of this message - Recommended setting this to 1


== Generating Audio

All voice lines spoken by ADA (and the Aliens) are generated using Google's Text-to-Speech API.




== BELOW IS OLD VERSION

[NOTE]
====
You have found a hidden docs page!

This page is a work in progress.

Currently, it's just a rough write up that I (Robb) made while implementing ADA messages in my own mod.

It's quite out of date but will Eventually(TM) be updated.
====

Look at either
https://github.com/budak7273/ArmorModules[PowerSuit Modules]
or
~~Ficsit Networks~~ (FIN no longer has ADA messages)
for examples.

Messages are two parts - the voice line and the file that shows up in the inbox

You can just download the content folder and add it as a separate content folder
within your modding project to be able to poke around in the UAssets and see how things are set up.

Strongly suggested you try and keep with the writing style of the game for ADA messages
Speaking mannerisms, patterns in what she says across voice lines
link:{attachmentsdir}/Development/Satisfactory/AdaMessages/All_Vanilla_ADA_Voicelines.txt[reference file]
For more examples check PowerSuit modules

the sound wave goes in the Dialogue Sounds array of an FGAudioMessage, there are lots of other settings there as well

Need custom BP code inside of InitGameWorld to register them since SML doesn't by default

Need to add a new variable to your InitGameWorld for the the schematic-Message mapping.

Don't need to create a new sender unless you want. Can reuse ADA without issue.

You can reuse the same Audiokinetic event for all of your messages.

You can record ADA voicelines using either pacas01's github project (need google api key thingy + billing set up) or you can use audacity loopback to record them from your own computer audio. waveset C pitch -1.2 (a bit hard to select on the slider, try dragging it far away then guesstimating where it needs to be). if using audacity loopback use the best quality sound device you have and keep it set to a consistent volume when recording. DON'T use laptop speakers for example, they suck miserably

You may need to change the text of what the TTS is saying to not match what the captions are when saying certain words.
For example, to have it pronounce FICSIT correctly, use the word 'fixit'

It is strongly suggested that you keep the text you fed to the TTS on hand so you can re-record lines later if needed or figure out how you got it to say a specific word in the past.

Since this can be different from the text you want to display to the user in the inbox (ex. 'fixit' case) you should still keep a separate copy of this.


You can use the advanced format of telling the tts what to do to insert custom emphasis and pauses;
look at google's docs and example of this in the demo widget

Can't have newlines in messages - have to do separate AudioMessage AudioEvents

You can change the speaking rate if the boxes of multiple messages aren't really lining up with what is being said in the recording.
Usual is 0.065, I find 0.07 works well for these types

If you want to send more than one message event per schematic, for example one in Inbox and one in Tutorial, you will either have to modify the BP code, or set the schematic to grant a hidden schematic that is mapped to the other message, and grant the other one as an unlock reward
	if you do this
		the messages will queue up
		the other (granted as a reward) schematic will play first
		you must have a sound file associated with it still (see below section)
		you can make a schematic hidden by giving it an impossible dependency - for example, make it depend on the schematic `FGSchematic`
			this means that even if you grant the schematic as a reward this way it will still never actually show up in the terminal because the condition for showing up can't be fulfilled
		Look at powersuit modules' `SchematicClass_HiddenSchematic` and `Schematic_Hidden_ModuleKeybindsTutorial` for an example

If you have a message incoming that does not have a Dialogue Sounds file set, none of the messages in that 'queued batch' will play, it will cancel them all!
	to fix this, give it a sound file of just silence to play. Example of this in Powersuit Modules
