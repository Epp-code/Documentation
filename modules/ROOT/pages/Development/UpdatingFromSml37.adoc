TODO SML3.8 feature summary.

First, please _read this entire page before you begin updating your mod_.
It will save you time later to have an idea going in of what to expect while updating.

After you have finished reading this page,
follow the directions on the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod]
guide to install the updated engine, starter project, and update your mod.

== New Features

=== Session Setting Replication

TODO

SML correctly handles Session Setting replication to multiplayer clients for you now.
Thanks SirDigby and Mircea (TODO who else to credit?) for implementing this.

=== SML Capable of Running Client-Side Only

It is now possible have SML installed on your client even when the server does not have SML installed.
This means you can create client-side mods that work when connected to vanilla servers.
An example of a mod that implements this functionality is https://ficsit.app/mod/InfiniteNudge[Infinite Nudge].

Of course, a number of certain things will not be possible without the server also having SML installed.

TODO do the 1.0 custom networking changes Arch mentioned affect this?

=== Content Tag Registry

SML now offers a registry to assist mods with using
https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/using-gameplay-tags-in-unreal-engine?application_version=5.3[Unreal Gameplay Tags].

Gameplay Tags are a useful way to introduce some cross-mod compatibility without hard dependencies on other mods.

Read the xref:Development/ModLoader/ContentTagRegistry.adoc[Content Tag Registry] page for more information.

[id="SMLNoLongerHardRequired"]
=== Mods No Longer Require a Dependency on SML

Although 99% of mods should still depend on SML for its feature set,
Ficsit.app now supports uploading mods without an SML dependency.
If you think your mod is part of the 1%,
read more on the xref:Development/Satisfactory/ModsWithoutSML.adoc[Modding Without SML] page.

== Not Done Yet

The following features are not quite ready to use yet.
This section will change often, so be sure to come back here and check as you update your mods!

TODO compare below with 3.8 feature set

=== Content Registry Issue with Mod Schematics Depending on Vanilla Schematics

See https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/issues/248[this github issue for more info].
This should not affect the vast majority of mods.

=== Decal_Normal Broken on Modded Parts using Mesh Proxies

TODO did 1.0 fix?

Mesh proxies past the first instance may not render correctly.
This is a UE5 issue that Coffee Stain is working with Epic Games to resolve.
You can work around this for the time being by using a default masked material.

=== Advanced Game Settings values not saved

The xref:Development/ModLoader/SessionSettings.adoc[Session Settings] page
explains how you can create your own Advanced Game Settings.
However, their values are not currently saved with the save file.
Session Settings still function correctly - their values are saved.

== Required Changes

In addition to any specific-to-your-mod issues you may encounter,
the changes described below _must_ be made in order for your mod to be updated.

=== Dependency Updates

The following project dependencies have updated.
Install the updated versions as you follow the xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod] guide.

==== Engine Update

Satisfactory 1.0 brings the game to Unreal Engine 5.3.
Download and set up our custom release while following the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod guide].

==== Wwise Update

With a new Unreal Engine version comes a new required Wwise update for your project.
The xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/dependencies.adoc#_wwise[Dependencies page Wwise instructions]
lists the new Wwise version and guides you through integrating it into your project as you follow the
xref:Development/UpdatingToNewVersions.adoc[Updating your Mod guide].

==== CLang Toolchain Update

Working with the updated Unreal Engine version requires an updated CLang toolchain.
Insalling it is covered in the
xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/dependencies.adoc#ClangToolchain[Dependencies page CLang Toolchain instructions].

=== Understanding New Game Targets

TODO how does the `FactoryGameSteam`/`FactoryGameEGS` split affect modders and the packaging process?

=== Alpakit Changes

Understanding the changes to Alpakit, and the new features added in this update, will help you work efficiently.

==== Alpakit Dev and Alpakit Release Split into Separate Windows

The Alpakit Release functionality (for creating release builds) has been brought into its own window to help with UI readability
and understanding which Alpakit settings are relevant to development time.

You can open the new Alpakit windows via these buttons in Unreal Editor's toolbar or the File dropdown menu.

image:Development/UpdatingGuides/AlpakitButtons38.png[Screenshot of new Alpakit buttons]

==== Launch Game Type: Custom Split into Path and Arguments

If you were previously using, for example,
`powershell.exe C:/Git/SF_ModProject/RobWorkingDir/SFLaunch_Advanced.ps1 -branch EXP -loadLatestSave`
you should now use:

* Custom Path: `powershell`
* Custom Launch Args: `C:/Git/SF_ModProject/RobWorkingDir/SFLaunch_Advanced.ps1 -branch EXP -loadLatestSave`

==== New Alpakit Log Feature: Time Since Last Pack

The Alpakit Log now displays the time a last successful pack was completed.
Great for if you started packing something, went to do something else, and came back but can't remember what exactly you started!

[id="Alpakit_GameVersionDependency"]
== Game Version Dependency

Ficsit.app now requires uploaded mods to specify a minimum game version with which the mod is compatible.
The reasoning behind this is explained in link:#SMLNoLongerHardRequired[this section].

Alpakit will warn you in the Alpakit Release window if your mod's game version is older than the project's game version.
Clicking on this warning will automatically update the field for you.

SML will check this game version at runtime,
requiring that the player's game version is greater than or equal to the listed required version.

== Additional Changes

You might not be affected by these changes,
but we'd like to draw extra attention to them.

== Add Special Item Tag to Relevant Items in your Mod

If your mod adds any item descriptors that serves a special non-crafting purpose,
like the Any Undefined, Wildcard, Overflow, and None sorting rule in the base game,
use the xref:Development/ModLoader/ContentTagRegistry.adoc[Content Tag Registry]
to add the `SML.Registry.Item.SpecialItemDescriptor` tag to it.
See that page for more information.

== Funchook Improvements

We have switched to our own custom build of Funchook to (hopefully) avoid the
https://github.com/satisfactorymodding/SatisfactoryModLoader/issues/235[rare inconsistent hooking crash issue].
If your mod makes use of hooking (and especially unhooking), watch for any bugs that may arise related to this
and let us know on the discord if you encounter any issues.

== Starter Project Structure page

The new xref:Development/BeginnersGuide/StarterProjectStructure.adoc[Starter Project Structure]
documentation page explains important Starter Project folders and the Placeholder System in more detail.
